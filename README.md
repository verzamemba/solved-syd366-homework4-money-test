Jenny employs a small team, including some office, sales, and warehouse staff.  A few times a year, Jenny attends trade shows and visits manufacturers to learn about new products.   Jenny uses an outside delivery service to deliver orders to her customers.

Your team has started looking at Jenny’s financial records and found that Jenny allows for different payment methods and would like to categorize her income and expense transactions accordingly.

Your team leader has written the following scenarios to capture Jenny’s requirements.
